Week 5 (2022-03-21 to 2022-03-27)
===

* Read [The use of machines to assist in rigorous proof](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/37442.pdf)
  (thanks to Rodrigo for the pointer)
* Attempt to implement a meta logic system, where sequents could take either formulas
  or other sequents as well
  * The implementation of other mechanisms that relied on this foundation turned out to be
    too complicated and left too many design choices open. Therefore, I decided to leave this
    idea aside and resume the regular implementation I had started.
* Refactored the front and allow high order functions to work with unification (although
  we don't expect them to be inferred, yet)
* Rules now support forward proofs as well, without having to implement any additional logic
