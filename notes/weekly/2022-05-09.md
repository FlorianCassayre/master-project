Week 12 (2022-05-09 to 2022-05-15)
===

* Add Scala documentation to most of the relevant entities
* Started writing parts of the thesis
  * The writing is taking place on Overleaf rather than locally, as advised, however I will try to synchronize it with
    the repository regularly (for version control and backup purposes)
* Refactored the proof state mutation procedure, now OO-style and allows justifications to be used directly when
  summoning new goals
  * Still not fully satisfied with the organization, will have to spend more time thinking about it
* [lampepfl/dotty#15145](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/15145)
