Week 4 (2022-03-14 to 2022-03-20)
===

* Read (parts of the more complete tutorial) [A Proof Assistant for HOL](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/doc/tutorial.pdf)
* Wrote short documentation for the different components that have been implemented
* Improve the front proof module, in particular add support for tactics and theorems
* Tweak the parser, syntax is now non-ambiguous
* Start working on a new iteration for the front:
  * The current implementation could already be useful in its own, however it's not as expressive as
    it could be. For instance, rules only produce sequents and they can only take the result of other
    rules as arguments.
  * In this new version, a rule still defines a sequence of hypotheses and a single conclusion, however
    the type of these can be either another rule or a sequent.
