\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

A proof assistant is a piece of software that can assist a human user in writing a particular type of proofs, one that can be verified by a machine. Proofs following this format are desirable because it suffices to show that the verification procedure is sound to automatically and irrefutably judge any of them. Computer-assisted theorem proving can also leverage the computational capabilities offered by machines, one of the most famous example being the proof of the \textit{four-color conjecture} \cite{Appel1989}. However, the greatest strength of proof assistants might also be their greatest weakness: they are often complex systems, whose correctness is difficult to demonstrate and therefore are prone to bugs in their implementation. They also suffer from a lack of understandability, both in terms of the underlying theories used and of the proofs produced, which results in a low adoption rate by mathematicians \cite{Ayers2021}.

In this thesis we describe the design process of a front-end for the modern proof assistant LISA. Our main focus is to preserve the same soundness standards as the existing framework while making it more expressive and interactive.

\subsection{LISA}

LISA\footnote{\textbf{L}ISA \textbf{I}s \textbf{S}ets \textbf{A}utomated} is an ongoing project conducted at the Lab for Automated Reasoning and Analysis (LARA), EPFL. It is a library built on top of sequent calculus and set theory that enables the formalization of mathematical proofs \cite{Guilloud2022-2}.

  \caption[Proof tree (1)]{An example of a proof in sequent calculus. This proof demonstrates the tautology $\neg{?a}\lor{?b}\Leftrightarrow{?a}\Rightarrow{?b}$. The question mark indicates a schema, namely a variable that can later be instantiated. The inference rule used at every step is indicated on the right.}

  \caption[Proof in LISA]{A representation of the proof of \autoref{fig:simple-lisa-proof-graph} in LISA. Each step is assigned an index, and import are represented with negative indices. Scoping within the proof is possible and determined by the indentation level: subproofs are indented further down. The second column states what rule is used, along with the premises it uses. The third column is the conclusion of that step. The last column contains parameters to disambiguate the application of the rule.}

A proof in this system is a directed acyclic graph of proof steps. Each such step corresponds to the application of an inference rule, and is characterized by its conclusion expressed as a sequent, and some premises. A sequent is a pair of sets of formulas, noted $\phi_1, \phi_2, ..., \phi_n \vdash \psi_1, \psi_2, ..., \psi_m$ or $\Gamma \vdash \Delta$, and can be interpreted in conventional logic as a conjunction of premises implying a disjunction of conclusions. That said, the actual semantic is controlled by the inference rules provided by the system. Proofs can optionally have ``imports'', sequents that can be used as premises, and proofs may also be nested for organization purposes. Figures \ref{fig:simple-lisa-proof-graph} and \ref{fig:simple-lisa-proof} showcase a formal proof in LISA. Notice that a directed acyclic graph can always be represented in a linear fashion, but not necessarily as a tree (unless we duplicate forward edges).

Currently LISA only exists as a Scala library, therefore the proofs are described using Scala code. For further technical details about LISA, we refer the reader to the official manual \cite{Guilloud2022-2}.
