Report
===

The thesis report can be built locally using:

```
make thesis
```

It is built by GitHub Actions on every commit push and the artifacts can be retrieved under the corresponding Actions workflow. Note that the artifacts expire after some time. The final version of the manuscript will be published as a release.

Additionally, the currently up-to-date version is hosted on Overleaf (access is reserved to collaborators):
