	abstract     = {A methodology for computer assisted proof is presented with an example. A central ingredient in the method is the presentation of tactics (or strategies) in an algorithmic metalanguage. Further, the same language is also used to express combinators, by which simple elementary tactics - which often correspond to the inference rules of the logic employed - are combined into more complex tactics, which may even be strategies complete for a class of problems. However, the emphasis is not upon completeness but upon providing a metalogical framework within which a user may express his insight into proof methods and may delegate routine (but error-prone) work to the computer. This method of tactic composition is presented at the start of the paper in the form of an elementary theory of goal-seeking. A second ingredient of the methodology is the stratification of machine-assisted proof by an ancestry graph of applied theories, and the example illustrates this stratification. In the final section, some recent developments and applications of the method are cited.}

They include a highly readable structured language of proofs and a unique interactive development environment for editing live proof documents. Everything rests on the foundation conceived by Robin Milner for Edinburgh LCF: a proof kernel, using abstract types to ensure soundness and eliminate the need to store proofs. Compared with the research prototypes of the 1970s, Isabelle is a practical and versatile tool. It is used by system designers, mathematicians and many others.},

The terms t and u are from the simply typed lambda calculus and the same normal form is with respect to βη-equivalence. Higher-order matching is the particular instance when the term u is closed; can t be pattern matched to u? Although higher-order unification is undecidable, higher-order matching was conjectured to be decidable by Huet [2]. Decidability was shown in [7] via a game-theoretic analysis of β-reduction when component terms are in η-long normal form.In the talk we outline the proof of decidability. Besides the use of games to understand β-reduction, we also emphasize how tree automata can recognize terms of simply typed lambda calculus as developed in [1, 3-6].}
