\begin{itemize}
\item Thank you everyone for coming, both physically and virtually.
\item I am going to present the work I conducted during my Master thesis at the laboratory for automated reasoning and analysis, here at EPFL. It consisted in the design of a front-end framework for an existing proof system.
\item Before diving into the subject I would like to thank Professor Kunčak and Simon for proposing and supervising this project, it was a rich and stimulating experience.
