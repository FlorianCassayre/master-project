\item This is the agenda of the presentation. I am not going to cover all the details of my work, but rather give a high-level overview that will hopefully be comprehensive enough for those that are not necessarily familiar with the field of study.
\item I will start by introducing you to LISA, which the core tool that my project builds onto.
\item Then I will describe the possibilities offered by my framework to write proofs.
\item I will discuss in more details about a particular matching procedure for sequent calculus that I designed for the framework.
\item Finally I will showcase the language features of the framework.
\end{itemize}
