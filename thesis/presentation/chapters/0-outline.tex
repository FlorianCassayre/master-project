\note{
\begin{itemize}
\item This is the agenda of the presentation. I am not going to cover all the details of my work, but rather provide you with a high-level overview that will hopefully be comprehensive enough for those that are not necessarily familiar with the domain of study.
\item I will start by introducing you to LISA, which is a core tool that my project depends on.
\item Then I will describe the possibilities offered by my framework to write proofs.
\item I will discuss in more details about the matching algorithm designed for and used by my framework.
\item Finally I will showcase the domain specific language. % TODO
\end{itemize}
