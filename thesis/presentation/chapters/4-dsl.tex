val a = SchematicPredicateLabel[0]("a")

a /\ (!a ==> a): Formula (@\onslide<2-3>@)

val t = SchematicFunctionLabel[0]("t") (@\onslide<2>@)

p(t): Formula
p(t, t): Formula // error (@\onslide<3>@)

\only<1>{\note{
\begin{itemize}
\item The framework I designed also defines its own domain specific language, that provides additional compile-time guarantees to that of LISA's making it safer at usage.
\item For instance, the labels have their arity encoded as a singleton type. A singleton type has the special property that it can be translated into a value at compilation time: here "0" is a literal type, which is also singleton.
\item The motivation for that is to enforce the correct number of arguments. "a" does not expect any argument here and so its usage in this context is legal.
\end{itemize}
}}

\only<2>{\note{
\begin{itemize}
\item This is illustrated in that second example. "p" expects one argument. Passing more than one argument will trigger a type error.
\end{itemize}
}}

\only<3>{\note{
\begin{itemize}
\item We also provide convenient constructors for lambda terms. They are represented as values at runtime, rather than Scala functions. They are used in substitutions.

\begin{lstlisting}

val p = SchematicPredicateLabel[1]("p")

sequent"|- (@\lstid{\$f1}@); (@\lstid{\$p}@)(?t)" (@\onslide<3>@)

val x = VariableLabel("x")

formula"forall (@\lstid{\$x}@). ?p((@\lstid{\$x}@))"

\only<1>{
\note{
\begin{itemize}
\item The framework also defines a language for sequents and formulas, which can be parsed and printed. Without entering into the details I will present an interesting language feature that is used; that is string interpolation.
\item In Scala string interpolation is a syntactic sugar that allows us to translate a string into something else. The particularity is that the string can contain Scala expressions as well.
