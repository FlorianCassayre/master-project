Week 3 (2022-03-07 to 2022-03-13)
===

* Reading more conceptual documentation about Isabelle (new documents mentioned below)
  * [Isar Reference Manual](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2021-1/doc/isar-ref.pdf)
  * [Isabelle Cheatsheet](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/ar/isabelle/FormalCheatSheet.pdf)
  * [HOL: Propositional Logic (slides)](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/coursematerial/PSV2009-1/session45/document.pdf)
* Wrote a simple unification algorithm using nullary schemas
* Started working on the next iteration of the front, using the experimental work done in `GoalBasedProofSystem`
  * Rules work in a similar way as the "tactics", except that they are represented in a simpler way.
    Namely, their implementation does not contain code but rather static trees with schemas in them.
    That way we can apply the above unification algorithm to achieve the same goal
* Ported and adapted the front FOL package. It's a copy of the kernel FOL package with additional syntactical features
  and type safety guarantees
* Add support for multi-ary connector schemas to neatly represent the iff substitution "rule"
  * Perhaps it wasn't worth the effort since non-zero ary schemas may produce an infinite number of solutions
    when applying the rule. Of course, it is possible to infer the expected parameter most of the time but
    without guarantees
* Future work:
  * Write a procedure to convert instantiated static rules into a proven sequent
  * Define a way to compose tactics (possibly into other tactics)

  Brief description of the front:
  
  The proof state is an ordered collection of goals
  (represented as individual sequents) that need to be
  proven. A proof in the front is said to be complete
  when there are no goals remaining in the proof state.
  
  A "rule" in the front is made of two parts:
  * A collection of hypotheses (top)
  * A unique conclusion (bottom)
  
  A rule can be applied to a proof goal. This is done
  by matching the bottom part to the current goal (with
  possibly some hints, when that is necessary), and
  producing zero or more new goals. Rules are thus applied
  backwards in the front.
  
  Proofs in the front should not be trusted. Instead,
  the front has another capability which is that it can
  reconstruct a kernel proof, that can be later verified.
  
  
  Example of a rule definition in the front:
  
  ... |- ?a, ...    ... |- ?b, ...
  ================================
        ... |- ?a /\ ?b, ...
  
  Provided the index of the /\ formula in the sequent,
  this rule can be applied without having to state the
  value of ?a and ?b.
  In addition the rule has to provide a blueprint
  for the reconstruction into kernel proof steps:
  
  (1)     (2)
  ----------- RightAnd [phi := val(?a), psi := val(?b)]
      bot
  
  The following parameters are all provided:
  * (1) and (2) are the indices of the hypotheses
  * `bot` is the bottom sequent
  * `val` is a function that returns the assignment for a schema
  
  
  Here is a more interesting rule:
  
  ... |- ?f(?a), ...    ... |- ?a <-> ?b, ...
  ===========================================
              ... |- ?f(?b), ...
  
  Notice that in this case, the schema ?a does not
  appear in the conclusion, therefore we expect
  the user to state it explicitly. Similarly,
  unification may find several solutions for ?f.
  The reconstruction blueprint is defined as follows:
  
                  (1)
  ----------------------------------- RightSubstIff [phi := val(?f)(?p), h := ?p, fa := val(?a), fb := val(?b)]
  bot.l, val(?a) <-> val(?b) |- bot.r       (2)  
  --------------------------------------------- Cut [phi := val(?a) <-> val(?b)] 
                      bot
  
  When writing a front proof, these rules can be
  called one after the other. In the future, it will
  be possible to compose rules both in a static and
  dynamic way.
  For instance, a solver is represented as a rule that 
  matches any conclusion and that does not have hypotheses.
  On the other hand, a simplification tactic also matches any 
  conclusion but does not know in advance what the
  hypotheses will look like.
