Week 1 (2022-02-21 to 2022-02-27)
===

* Read literature about existing systems: design choices, motivations and fundamental differences
  * [From LCF to Isabelle/HOL](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.02836.pdf)
  * [Comparison of Two Theorem Provers: Isabelle/HOL and Coq](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.09701.pdf)
* Extensive review of the documentation of [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/refman/proofs/writing-proofs/index.html) and 
  [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2021-1/doc/prog-prove.pdf)
* Adapt some of my existing work from [lisa-core](http://github.com/epfl-lara/lisa-core)
  (the draft repository) to [lisa](http://github.com/epfl-lara/lisa):
  * [`SCProofStepFinder`](https://github.com/FlorianCassayre/master-project/blob/649a7a8ee44de0b0602481321eb8ec2aef883015/src/main/scala/masterproject/SCProofStepFinder.scala),
    which can now handle imports as premises
  * [`MonadicSCProofBuilder`](https://github.com/FlorianCassayre/master-project/blob/649a7a8ee44de0b0602481321eb8ec2aef883015/src/main/scala/masterproject/MonadicSCProofBuilder.scala),
    needed some adaptation to have the sub-proofs working again
  * [`SCProofBuilder`](https://github.com/FlorianCassayre/master-project/blob/649a7a8ee44de0b0602481321eb8ec2aef883015/src/main/scala/masterproject/SCProofBuilder.scala),
    aggregation of the imports in the high level steps, added a way to include explicit proof steps
* Designed new modules:
  * [`GoalBasedProofSystem`](https://github.com/FlorianCassayre/master-project/blob/649a7a8ee44de0b0602481321eb8ec2aef883015/src/main/scala/masterproject/GoalBasedProofSystem.scala),
    inspired by existing work I designed a prototype framework that implement a form of tactic calculus.
    It enables the user to write proof backwards (starting from the conclusion and closing all the branches)
    using tactics. A tactic defines a transformation on the proof state and a callback to recreate the sequent calculus proof step(s).
    The state of the proof is updated live as the tactics are applied. It's only when all the goals are cleared that the sequent calculus proof is reconstructed.
    A tactic can generate multiple proof steps; this is feature makes it possible to integrate existing strategies as a tactic (such as the propositional solver).
    The indices of the high level proof steps are automatically translated.
  * [`parser`](https://github.com/FlorianCassayre/master-project/tree/649a7a8ee44de0b0602481321eb8ec2aef883015/src/main/scala/masterproject/parser),
    a sequent parser designed to be coherent with respect to the LISA `Printer`.
    This opens the possibility of interaction.
    This parser is incomplete due to the ambiguity in the grammar (in some situations it is impossible to tell terms and formulas apart).
  * [`GoalBasedProofSystemREPL`](https://github.com/FlorianCassayre/master-project/blob/649a7a8ee44de0b0602481321eb8ec2aef883015/src/main/scala/masterproject/GoalBasedProofSystemREPL.scala),
    a simple implementation of a REPL for the above proof system
