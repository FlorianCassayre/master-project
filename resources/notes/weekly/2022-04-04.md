Week 7 (2022-04-04 to 2022-04-10)
===

* Formalize the specification of the future unification algorithm
* Begin the implementation of the said unification algorithm
  * For the most part the implementation is complete, however the development was
    stopped after discovering edge cases that were not covered by the specification.
    They will require additional thinking to be overcomed ("what do we really want?")
* Create a positional version of the printer
* Read the documentation about Dotty macros
* Complete a working implementation of custom string interpolators
  * They are currently implemented at runtime, but work has been done to move them
    to compilation time, bringing additional safety guarantees and improved error
    reporting
* [lampepfl/dotty#14858](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/14858)
