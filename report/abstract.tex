  We propose a front-end framework for the novel proof system LISA. Both systems are based on Gentzen's sequent calculus with first-order logic and are implemented in the Scala programming language. Our framework supports different proof styles and provides a language to describe tactics. The application of tactics is assisted by inferring the parameters thanks to a matching procedure. All the proofs written in our framework can then be translated into the kernel for verification. We demonstrate that our framework simplifies the process of writing proofs for LISA, and that it is suitable for an interactive use. We also introduce relevant components for LISA such as a strongly typed programming interface, a two-way parser and printer, and a proof simplifier.
